## About

TaxGPT is an experimental AI chat service that helps Canadians better understand their options for free tax filing. TaxGPT is under active development, so the flow as well as the wording is likely to change between releases.

TaxGPT.ca is not a Government of Canada service. You can try out Charlie the Chatbot on the Canada Revenue Agency’s website, but he doesn’t know too much about your 2022 basic personal amount, and he’s not very good at jokes.

If you spot an error, want to make a suggestion, or just want to give me a virtual high-five, please reach out to paul@pcraig3.ca. My goal is to get back to you within 2 weeks if you message online, or 8 weeks if you send me a paper letter.

The source code for TaxGPT.ca is on Github, and the chatbot interaction is created with Typebot.

## FAQ

If you have a question that’s not on here, please get in touch.

### Is TaxGPT a Government of Canada service?

Nope. if it was a government service, it would have a Canadian flag at the top of the page.

### What happens to my data?

The information needed by TaxGPT is not detailed enough to identify you. The only personal information you are asked for is your first name, and you can just make that up.

If you want your data removed, send me your first name and the approximate time that you used TaxGPT and I will get rid of it.

### Is TaxGPT a scam?

Nope, not a scam. If TaxGPT was a scam, it would probably ask you for specific financial details, like your address or banking information.

On the other hand, if this was a scam, it would definitely claim not to be a scam.

### Can I file taxes through TaxGPT?

No. You can browse CRA’s list of approved NETFILE software, there are both free and paid options. I personally recommend Wealthsimple Tax.

### Are you sponsored by WealthSimple?

No, this is not a branded or sponsored product — TaxGPT is a completely free service. I don’t make any money on this — I am actually losing tons of money on this.

There are other free tax filing services. Why do you only recommend Wealthsimple Tax?

I think Wealthsimple Tax is the best product for most people.

Some other tax filing products offer a free tier but then they try to undermine your confidence before you hit ‘submit’ — either suggesting you could get more money back with the more full-featured verison, or recommending a person look it over.

The main reason that Canadians don’t file on their own is a lack of confidence, and design patterns and marketing campaigns that reinforce that message reinforce the mistaken notion that tax filing is something best left to professionals.

We don’t need “voting professionals” to fill out ballots for us during elections; similarly, most Canadians are capable of filing their own returns with the right tool and some encouragement.

That’s why I highlight Wealthsimple specifically.

If you offer or know of another tax-filing product without dark design patterns, please reach out.

### There’s a problem with the quiz.

Yes, it’s certainly possible. Please reach out and I will do my best to address it.

Just a note that the quiz is trying to simplify the tax journey for people with a modest income and/or a simple tax scenario. It isn’t trying to cover every possibility — if you have a complex tax situation, you are probably aware.

### I got some inaccurate information back from TaxGPT when I asked it a question

The “question and answer” part at the end uses AI to give you an answer, which, in my experience, is usually pretty good, but definitely not foolproof.

### Why build this?

Doing taxes should be easy and straightforward, so TaxGPT tries to embody that.
