## About

TaxGPT is an experimental AI chatbot advisor to help Canadians better understand their options for free tax filing. TaxGPT is under active development, so the question flow or the specific wording may change between releases.

**TaxGPT is not sponsored by any company, it’s a 100% free service with no affiliations.**

TaxGPT is also _not_ a Government of Canada service. You can [chat with Charlie the Chatbot](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax.html) on the Canada Revenue Agency’s website, but he doesn’t know your basic personal amount for 2022, and he’s not very good with emojis.

The source code for [TaxGPT.ca is on GitHub](https://github.com/pcraig3/tax-gpt), and I used [Typebot](https://typebot.io/) for the chatbot interaction, which I found to be excellent.

The adorable [Canadian maple leaf](/robot.svg) mascot is [Tyler Benning’s](https://tylerbenning.com).

### Contact

If you spot an error, want to make a suggestion, or just want to give me a virtual high-five, please reach out to me at [paul@pcraig3.ca](mailto:paul@pcraig3.ca). I will aim get back to you within 2 days if you message online, or 8 weeks if you send me a paper letter.

I am kind of a one-person team over here, so there are definitely some rough edges.

## FAQ

If you have a question that’s not on here, [get in touch](mailto:paul@pcraig3.ca) and I might add it to the list.

### Is TaxGPT a Government of Canada service?

Nope. If it was a government service, it would have [a Canadian flag at the top of the page](https://design.canada.ca/common-design-patterns/global-header.html).

You can visit the [Canada Revenue Agency’s website](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax.html) for comprehensive personal tax filing information.

### Is TaxGPT a scam?

Nope, not a scam. If TaxGPT was a scam, it would ask you for specific personal/financial details, like your home address or banking information.

On the other hand, if this _was_ a scam, it would definitely claim not to be a scam.

(Not a scam though, to be clear.)

### Can I file taxes through TaxGPT?

No. You can browse [the Canada Revenue Agency’s list of approved NETFILE software](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/netfile-overview/certified-software-netfile-program.html#h_1) for official tax filing applications — there are both free and paid options.

**I personally recommend [Wealthsimple Tax](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tax).**

### What happens to my data?

TaxGPT needs general information about your financial situation to make tailored recommendations about free tax-filing. **However, data collected by TaxGPT can’t be used to identify you in any way**.

I analyze the data to see how TaxGPT is performing and improve the service.

### Are you making money from this?

No, this is not a branded or sponsored product — TaxGPT is a completely free service. I am paying to host it, and I don’t make any money back in any way.

I am actually losing tons of money on this — [someone who is good at the economy please help me budget this](https://twitter.com/dril/status/384408932061417472?lang=en).

### Why build this?

Doing taxes should be simple and straightforward, so TaxGPT tries to embody that.

### There are other free tax-filing services. Why do you only recommend Wealthsimple Tax?

I think [Wealthsimple Tax](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tax) is the best product for most people.

Some other tax filing products offer a free tier but then they try to undermine your confidence before you hit ‘submit’ — either suggesting you could get more money back with a paid verison, or recommending you have an expert look it over.

The main reason that Canadians don’t file on their own is a lack of confidence, and design patterns and marketing campaigns that reinforce that message reinforce the mistaken notion that tax filing is something best left to professionals.

We don’t need “voting professionals” to fill out ballots for us during elections; similarly, most Canadians are capable of filing their own returns with the right tool and some encouragement.

That’s why I highlight Wealthsimple Tax specifically.

If you know of another free tax-filing product without dark design patterns, please reach out.

### There’s a problem with the quiz

Great, that’s just the feedback I am looking for. Please reach out and I will do my best to address it.

Just note that the quiz tries to simplify the tax journey for people with a modest income and/or a simple tax scenario. It isn’t trying to cover every possibility — I am trying to simplify things for the huge number of people that [use EFILE to file their taxes](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/individual-income-tax-return-statistics.html) each year.
