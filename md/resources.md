## Quick explainers

Simple explanations of key concepts.

### What is a simple tax situation?

The [Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program.html) defines a ‘simple tax situation’ based on income sources. You most likely have a simple tax situation if your income comes from your job, your pension, government benefits, or investments under $1,000.

A simple tax situation is related to your sources of income, not the amount.

Canadians with a salary and RRSP contributions or income from government benefit programs usually have a simple tax scenario with fairly straightforward filing requirements. If this sounds like you, you should be able to [file for free online](#what-are-my-options-for-self-filing-online%3F).

### How do I know if I have a simple tax situation?

[Ask TaxGPT](/) to get a rough idea.

Or, check the [eligibility criteria on this Canada Revenue Agency webpage](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/about.html). You have to scroll down — look for the "eligibility criteria" text.

### What is the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program?

CVITP is a bad acronym but a good program. It is a national network of **volunteers who file taxes for free** for Canadians with a _simple tax situation_ and a _modest income_. CVITP clinics accept [walk-ins or virtual appointments](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/need-a-hand-complete-your-tax-return.html#whatfree) you can do from your home.

[CVITP’s eligibility criteria](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/about.html) defines maximum income levels as well.

If you are interested, you can [search for a CVITP clinic near you](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/need-a-hand-complete-your-tax-return.html#freeclinic).

### What are my options for self-filing online?

In Canada, you can use approved applications to file taxes yourself. Some tax filing apps are free while others charge a fee. If you currently pay to file your taxes online, or if you pay for someone to do your taxes in person, you can save money by filing your own taxes for free.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides [a list of software you can use to file your taxes for free](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/netfile-overview/certified-software-netfile-program.html#h_1). However, many of them try to upsell you: trying to get you to pay more for extra features or for someone to review your information.

**I recommend [Wealthsimple Tax](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tax)**, which is truly free.

If you have a [CRA My Account](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html), you can use Wealthsimple Tax to “auto-fill” your tax information from your T4. With a CRA Account, you can easily switch between different tax apps and bring your data with you.
